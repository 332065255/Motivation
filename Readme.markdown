# Motivation

Motivation is a Mac OS X screen saver inspired by [Alex MacCaw](https://twitter.com/maccaw)'s [Motivation Chrome Extension](http://blog.alexmaccaw.com/life-hacks). From Alex:

> …screen with a counter showing your age incrementing in real time… It’s a simple tool, but it helps me think about perspective a bit more, which in turn helps me optimize my time.

You can configure your age once you picked it in Screen Saver Preferences in System Preferences.


## Building

Xcode 7.0 beta 5 is required to build Motivation since it's written in Swift 2.
